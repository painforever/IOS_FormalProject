            	<h1>Employee Ownership</h1>

                <p>EagleForce believes  allowing employees to participate in the ownership of the company is an incentive that helps create an environment where employees are constantly working in the best interest of our customers - which ultimately leads to the success of Eagle Force.<br>

                  <br>

                </p>

                 <p>Employee Ownership in whole or in part is made through various forms of investment and employees are provided their share in the company after a certain length of employment and commitments to the company are achieved. Employee ownership is structured to increase production and profitability, and to improve employees' dedication and sense of ownership.<br>

                   <br>

                 </p>

                 <p>Profit sharing is made through individual bonus and incentive plans and are made independently of Employee Ownership.</p>
